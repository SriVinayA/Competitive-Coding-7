# Approach2: binary search
# Total Time Complexity: O(n Ã— log(max-min))
# Binary search range is (max-min) where:
# max = matrix[n-1][n-1]
# min = matrix[0][0]
# Each iteration does O(n) work in count_less_equal
# Total iterations: O(log(max-min))

# Space Complexity: O(1)
# Only using constant extra space for variables
# No additional data structures used
